/* This code is explicated in Chapter 12 of Designing Audio Objects for Max/MSP and Pd by Eric Lyon.  The external moogvcf~ is a port of Csound code based on a Moog VCF Simulation by Comajuncosas/Stilson/Smith.  The filter design is by Tim Stilson and Julius O. Smith III. The original Csound DSP design is by Josep Comajuncosas. The C code for Csound was written by Hans Mikelson.  The source files for this port in the Csound distribution are  "biquad.c" and "biquad.h".  Following is the copyright notice in the original code: ******************************************************************* Copyright (C) 1998, 1999, 2001 by Hans Mikelson, Matt Gerassimoff, Jens Groh, John ffitch, Steven Yi  This file is part of Csound.  The Csound Library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  Csound is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
